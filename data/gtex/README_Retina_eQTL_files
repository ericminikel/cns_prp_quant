README file for retina eQTL files in the Eye Genotype Expression database - EyeGEx (Ratnapriya et al., Nature Genetics 2019; http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0351-9)

eQTL analysis was performed using QTLtools (Delaneau et al., Nat Commun 2017; PMID: 28516912) in the cis mode. Quantile normalization was applied to log2(CPM + c) expression values. The 
CPM was calculated according to Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM)-normalized library sizes in Counts per Million (CPM) using edgeR, and the offset c of the log2(CPM + c) values was also 
specified by edgeR (version 3.18.1; Robinson et al., Bioinformatics 26: 139-140, 2010; Robinson et al., Genome Biol 11, R25 2010). In the linear regression model, we included supervised 
SVA-calculated batch effects as covariates using 3,009 potential housekeeping genes, along with AMD grading, age, sex, and population stratification variables. Genome build GRCh38.p7 
and Ensembl GRCh38.85, which corresponds to GENCODE v25, were used.

Column Descriptions for Retina.nominal.eQTL.chr[1-22].txt.gz generated by QTLtools (See https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/):

1.	Ensembl ID of target gene (GRCh38.85)
2.	Gene chromosome 
3.	Gene start
4.	Gene end
5.	Gene strand
6.	Number of variants tested in cis to gene
7.	Distance between variant and start of gene
8.	ID of variant (rsID of variant or rsID of variant + its coordinates or just its coordinates)
9.	Variant chromosome
10.	Variant start
11.	Variant end
12.	 P-value of association between variant and its target gene
13.	 Regression slope of association
14.	 Flag (0=false, 1=true) indicating if variant is the most significant eVariant for that gene

The first 14 columns in Retina.nominal.eQTL.chr[1-22].with_thresholds.txt.gz are identical to those in Retina.nominal.eQTL.chr[1-22].txt.gz. 
The two added columns are:

15.      genelevel_threshold: gene-level FDR threshold determined by the permutation pass	
16. 	 is_signif: denotes whether or not each eQTL passed this significance level


File header for Retina.perms_full.txt from the QTLtools website:
 
1. The phenotype ID
2. The chromosome ID of the phenotype
3. The start position of the phenotype
4. The end position of the phenotype
5. The strand orientation of the phenotype
6. The total number of variants tested in cis
7. The distance between the phenotype and the tested variant (accounting for strand orientation)
8. The ID of the top variant
9. The chromosome ID of the top variant
10. The start position of the top variant
11. The end position of the top variant
12. The number of degrees of freedom used to compute the P-values
13. Dummy
14. The first parameter value of the fitted beta distribution
15. The second parameter value of the fitted beta distribution (it also gives the effective number of independent tests in the region)
16. The nominal P-value of association between the phenotype and the top variant in cis
17. The corresponding regression slope
18. The P-value of association adjusted for the number of variants tested in cis given by the direct method (i.e. empirircal P-value)
19. The P-value of association adjusted for the number of variants tested in cis given by the fitted beta distribution. We strongly recommend to use this adjusted P-value in any downstream analysis
